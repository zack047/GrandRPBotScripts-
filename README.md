## Installation

Install latest version of python here https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.3/python-3.12.3-amd64.exe

then install the necessary python libraries using this command

### For Keyboard library
```bash
  pip install keyboard
  ```
### For pyautogui library 
```bash

``` 
### Navigate to Your Directory

If you have downloaded the Python files to a different directory, navigate to that directory using the following commands in PowerShell or Command Prompt:

```powershell
cd path\to\your\directory
```

Replace `path\to\your\directory` with the actual path where your files are saved.
Run the main script to start the bot once you see the path is correct where you have downloaded and extracted my files:

```powershell
python demorgan.py
```
## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Verify your Python version is 3.7 or higher.
- Check your configuration settings in `config.json`.
